# 🏡 Florida House Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning model** to predict house prices in Florida based on various features such as median income, house value, population, and location. The objective is not only to deliver a predictive model but also to strengthen my skills in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and end-to-end project development**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Real estate pricing is influenced by numerous factors including economic conditions, demographics, and geographical attributes. Accurate prediction of house prices can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.  

This project is designed with the following goals:
- Enhance my **data science and machine learning skills**.  
- Practice **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and data preprocessing.  
- Implement **supervised learning algorithms** for regression tasks.  
- Gain hands-on experience in building and evaluating predictive models.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used a structured housing dataset with features like income levels, location coordinates, and housing characteristics.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed trends and correlations.  
   - Visualized geographical price distribution.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Implemented regression models such as **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests**.  
   - Compared model performances using evaluation metrics like **RMSE and R² Score**.  

5. **Evaluation & Insights**  
   - Identified the most important features influencing housing prices.  
   - Highlighted real-world applicability in real estate pricing.
